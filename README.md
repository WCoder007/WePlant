# WePlant App :seedling:
Team BgB's entry for Tech Boston Hackathon 2020

**update : Winner, Best Hack using CockroachDB**

## Idea
Create an app that tells people their responsibility to not only plant a tree but also continue to take care of it!

## What Should the App Be Able To Do?
* Allow users to record the number of different plants they planted
* Allow the user to log when/how much they water their plant
* Send the user notifications to remind them to water their plant
* They tell the app how often they want to water it, but if we have time maybe we could develop it so that the app has built-in notifications for certain types of plants
Give the user “points” and the ability to level up when they care for their plant(s) well
  * Leaderboard
  * Rewards/Achievements/Badges
* (If we have time) A social media function where people can share their progress/advice for other gardeners

## What Frameworks and Languages Do We Want to Use to Program It?
* Web App using HTML/CSS/JS
* React.js / node.js  
* CockroachDB
* Google Firebase
* Figma for UI
